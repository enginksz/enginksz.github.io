During my studies, four of our articles were presented at two symposiums: EEB 2016 and IEEE SIU-2016. My undergraduate thesis was titled “The Robot Can Follow the Smell.”</p> <p>I then completed a master’s in Electronics Engineering at Istanbul Technical University, focusing on signal processing and probability theory. My thesis involved developing an image matching method for UAVs using deep learning models, combining the SuperPoint and SuperGlue techniques for feature matching between UAV images and satellite maps.</p> </body></html>
